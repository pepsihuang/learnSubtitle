1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay, so first of all, you made me laugh out loud with your Q&A responses with last week's

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
episode.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,880
Inside Spotify, they allow me to ask silly questions or whatever I would like to ask.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,720
And last week's question was, would you rather have a magic talking unicorn as your personal

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:29,080
life coach who gives you daily pep talks, or have a group of enthusiastic penguins follow

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:36,040
you around everywhere you go, cheering you on and giving you high fives whenever you

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,800
need a pick me up?

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,840
Who doesn't need that?

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,360
Of the hundreds that submitted, you were all split just about right down the middle with,

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,960
I will say, unicorns pulling ahead of the penguins ever so slightly.

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Too fun, too fun.

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,240
Thank you.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:02,520
If you're not familiar, if you look at Spotify with each episode, there is a Q&A and you

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,400
can enter in your vote.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,920
I cannot wait to see what this week's response will be.

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:17,800
Also London, Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Berlin, and Cologne.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:24,680
I'm going to be seeing you in the next week or two weeks, depending on where you live.

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,120
Please check out CometDownPodcast.com or Chad Lawson.com as I am touring the UK and Europe.

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,920
I would love to see you.

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,160
Please come see me.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,800
Some of the shows are getting very light on tickets, just so you know.

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,200
And then finally, I'm almost done.

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,200
I promise it's the beginning of a new month.

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,280
And you know what that means.

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,200
It's my time to ask for help.

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,080
As you may already know, this is an independent podcast.

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,920
It's truly a one man show.

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,640
I write, I record, I produce, I deliver.

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,400
It's truly just me by myself right now.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,480
But with your help, we can keep this podcast going strong.

31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,040
So I would be incredibly grateful if you could spare two or three dollars each month to help

32
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,440
me cover the expense.

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,480
And then eventually, when the budget allows, maybe even bring on some additional help.

34
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,880
That would be so amazing.

35
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,840
Your support means the world and you can help by heading over to CometDownPodcast.com, clicking

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,360
on the white coffee cup that says support me.

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,840
It honestly takes less than 60 seconds, but guys, it would help so much.

38
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,120
CometDownPodcast.com.

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,520
If you are already contributing, my heart says thank you.

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,520
Now on with the show.

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,840
So after writing these episodes, I've decided this is the first episode of a two part series

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,320
and maybe even more.

43
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,440
And I'm really excited to share this with you.

44
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,000
So this conversation is something that's really important to me.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,200
And I know it's something that many of you can relate to.

46
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,480
Feeling lost or unsure about where you want to be in life.

47
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,160
It's a common experience and it can leave us feeling empty, aimless.

48
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,320
And that's something that I hear a lot from you.

49
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,680
And so this is why I wanted to take the time to really dive into this topic and explore

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,440
it in depth over the next few episodes.

51
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,000
So whether you're feeling stuck in a rut or just looking to gain some clarity and direction

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,360
in your life, I hope you'll find some value in what I'm about to share.

53
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,800
Oddly enough, as I write this, I'm en route back home from a weekend road trip.

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:04:00,080
And it seems only fitting that today you and I are going to embark on a road trip of our

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
own.

56
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:10,840
Of course, this journey will be purely imaginary, but it will yield meaningful outcomes nonetheless.

57
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,120
So today we're going to take a road trip.

58
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,520
Let's hit the open road.

59
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,080
I want you to imagine that you are in need of some new scenery.

60
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,520
And for some of you, you may not have to imagine this.

61
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,440
Here, close your eyes with me.

62
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,080
Well, unless you're driving, of course.

63
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,200
But we'll imagine this together.

64
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,920
The four walls are closing in and you're ready for something different.

65
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,660
A change of scenery is just what you need.

66
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,620
So you pack your bags, hop in your car, and hit the road.

67
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,900
Come on, let's have some fun.

68
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,900
Wind is in your hair.

69
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,420
You can totally see it right now.

70
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,900
And you've got the windows down, you've got your music blasting, the road is yours.

71
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,340
There's nowhere to go, right?

72
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,420
Like where you're going, you're not going to be late, as it's totally up to you when

73
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,420
you arrive.

74
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,220
Now at first, this seems like a great idea, right?

75
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,420
Seems like a lot of fun.

76
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,820
You're exploring new places and you're enjoying the thrill of this open road.

77
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:25,620
But as an hour goes by, and second hour, and the third, and you've stopped at more antique

78
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,140
places than you can imagine, you've already had four cups of coffee, each from a different

79
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,140
place.

80
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:38,460
You've even stopped at a number of bakeries, to where you can't imagine eating another

81
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,460
cookie.

82
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,820
And as night falls, you eventually begin to feel a bit lost.

83
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,300
You're not really sure where you're going.

84
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,140
You're not really sure if you're really even making progress towards anything.

85
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,740
You're just kind of driving.

86
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:02,100
Yes, you have a map in front of you, but there's no real final destination marked on the map.

87
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,420
You haven't entered in a final address on your phone's GPS, and to be honest, you really

88
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,500
have no idea where you want to go at this point.

89
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,500
You're just kind of driving around aimlessly, hoping to stumble upon something, I don't

90
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,460
know, worthwhile.

91
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:24,020
It's probably not the most efficient way, or even satisfying way, to travel, is it?

92
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,020
Well, the same can actually be said for life.

93
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:34,100
When we don't have a direction, let alone a destination, we can end up feeling lost.

94
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,900
We can end up feeling aimless.

95
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,100
All dressed up, but nowhere to go, right?

96
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:49,220
Maps are more than just getting us from point A to point B. They're a guide for this journey,

97
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,100
helping us navigate through the twists and turns of life.

98
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:02,860
But even the greatest map, the most detailed GPS system, it's useless without an address.

99
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,780
It can't help you unless you tell it where you want to go.

100
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:16,580
I know this may sound kind of silly, but what is your emotional GPS?

101
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,220
Have you ever pulled off the road to even ask yourself?

102
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:28,500
It's hard, because it's important to have a clear destination in mind, so we can set

103
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,940
goals, and we can make plans, and we can enjoy this journey along the way.

104
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,420
So let me ask a question.

105
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,020
Where do you want to go?

106
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,580
What do you want to see?

107
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,020
What do you want to experience?

108
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:50,380
What goals have you set for yourself?

109
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:57,980
When we have a clear direction, a laid out roadmap, we can navigate through life's challenges,

110
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,100
and we can enjoy the ride.

111
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,620
We have kind of a compass, knowing that we're making progress towards something meaningful.

112
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:12,300
Otherwise, we just run the risk, driving in circles until our tank runs empty.

113
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,140
For some of you, you may already be there, empty.

114
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,980
But guess what?

115
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,980
Don't worry.

116
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,140
It's never too late to create a new map.

117
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:30,940
It's never too late to set a new destination, or even embark on a new journey.

118
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,300
Today, we are hitting the open road, and you're coming with me.

119
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,900
The emotional highway, not a cloud in the sky.

120
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,700
Are you ready?

121
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,940
Let's go.

122
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:52,500
I'm Chad Lawson, and let's count it down in 3, 2, 1.

123
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:59,700
When was the last time you paused to consider where you want to be emotionally?

124
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,220
Something we actually don't often think about, and yet it's really important, right?

125
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,220
It's a big question.

126
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,580
But a step further than that, how did we even open this box in the first place?

127
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,460
What if I don't know where I want to be emotionally, you may ask.

128
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,180
I completely understand, as I've been asking this myself, which is why I decided to make

129
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,580
this episode, as it's been something I've been working through personally.

130
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,580
Chad, you ask, where do I even start?

131
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,860
Well, first, let's start with, are you ready?

132
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,300
Your values.

133
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,420
Think about what's most important to you in life.

134
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:54,620
Your values serve as a guide for setting goals and making decisions.

135
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:01,140
Emotions are an essential part of our human experience, and yet we often neglect to consider

136
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:07,460
where we want to be emotionally in our life.

137
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,740
It's so easy to get caught up in the day to day and forget to check in with ourselves

138
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,780
on this deep emotional level.

139
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:22,060
One way to start thinking about where you want to be emotionally is to consider your

140
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
values.

141
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,660
What's most important to you in life?

142
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,660
Is it family?

143
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
Is it friends?

144
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,300
Is it personal growth?

145
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,740
Is it career success or something else?

146
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,260
Your values can serve as a guide for setting these emotional goals, because that's what

147
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:45,860
they are, and then making decisions that align with what's truly important to you.

148
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,660
I'm going to say that again.

149
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,900
Don't miss that.

150
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:57,700
Your values serve as a guide for setting emotional goals, and then making decisions that align

151
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,860
with those goals and with what's truly important to you.

152
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:10,260
For example, if personal growth is one of your core values, you might set a goal to

153
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:16,940
prioritize this word I know is overused, but self-care, right?

154
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:25,420
You might set a goal to prioritize working on managing stress in your life.

155
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,580
That's powerful.

156
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,980
Or if on the other hand, relationships are important to you, you might set a goal to

157
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,380
improve your communication skills, right?

158
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,220
And spend more quality time with loved ones, being able to connect, being able to learn

159
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,100
into ebb and flow in conversation.

160
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,420
And if you're feeling stuck and not sure where to start, maybe try journaling or talking

161
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,420
with a trusted friend or therapist even.

162
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:58,540
But think back to the moments in your life when you felt truly happy, when you felt truly

163
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,780
fulfilled.

164
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:06,100
What values were important to you during those times?

165
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,060
Was it spending time with loved ones?

166
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,820
Was it pursuing a passion?

167
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,820
Was it making a difference in someone else's life?

168
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,700
What values were important to you during those times?

169
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,780
These memories can provide incredible insight into what's really important to you on an

170
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,780
emotional level.

171
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:33,060
Now, I'm not going to lie, this might be a little difficult to go down memory lane.

172
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,700
Because a lot of times when we drive down memory highway, we don't turn off, right?

173
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
We don't take the exit.

174
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,740
We just keep going down memory lane.

175
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:49,300
But the purpose is going down these memories is to get insight, right?

176
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,180
To get insight into what was important to you at that time.

177
00:12:53,180 --> 00:13:01,500
And then to come back into the present and say, okay, I learned that back then, this

178
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,660
was what was valuable to me.

179
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,020
How do I incorporate that now?

180
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,020
Right?

181
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:15,060
So again, these memories, they can provide incredible insight into what's truly important

182
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,060
to you on an emotional level.

183
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,660
You can also look to others who inspire you and who possess emotional qualities that you

184
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,660
admire.

185
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:33,340
Maybe it's someone who's kind or empathetic or resilient, even.

186
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:38,540
Take note of those qualities and consider how you can incorporate them into your own

187
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,540
life, right?

188
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,060
Just by watching someone else that you really admire.

189
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,260
By learning from others and reflecting on your own experiences, you can work towards

190
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:55,580
becoming the best version of yourself emotionally.

191
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:03,220
But I want you to remember that emotional goals and growth, they're an ongoing process.

192
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,180
It's okay if you're not sure where you want to be right now.

193
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,180
It is.

194
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:15,300
But taking small steps and staying connected to your values, you can begin to create a

195
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:21,260
roadmap for this emotional journey.

196
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:27,780
Now the second destination is to define your long term vision.

197
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,860
Well, what do you mean?

198
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,300
Well, where do you want to be in five years?

199
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,100
Where do you want to be in 10?

200
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,380
Where do you want to be in 20 years?

201
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,220
I have to be honest, this is the one that I have the most difficult time with.

202
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,580
And so you're not alone.

203
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,300
And hopefully I'm not alone either with this one.

204
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:54,500
But long term, what kind of person do you want to be?

205
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,300
Oh, heavy, right?

206
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,100
What kind of life do you want to have?

207
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,700
I mean, it's almost overwhelming.

208
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,020
Well, let's break this down.

209
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,180
It can be a little overwhelming, right?

210
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,180
Thinking about the future.

211
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:15,060
But it's important to have a sense of what you want your life to look like, especially

212
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,020
in the long term.

213
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:22,900
So even drawing out or even a rough sketch of your long term vision, it's like creating

214
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,060
a roadmap, right?

215
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:30,540
It's a way to reflect on your hopes and dreams for the future and to set goals that will

216
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:36,180
take you closer to your vision, whether it's five years, 10 years, 20 years from now.

217
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:42,140
But having a clear sense of what you want to achieve, this can completely help you make

218
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,860
better decisions and stay focused on what really matters to you.

219
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,980
But it's just a matter of sitting down and putting this together, right?

220
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:57,180
So when you're thinking about your long term vision, I want you to consider a few questions.

221
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,980
I highly recommend you, as always, take some notes, maybe write this down.

222
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,980
Are you ready?

223
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,940
So I've already asked, where do you want to be in five years or 10 years or 20?

224
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:14,020
But what kind of life do you want to have?

225
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,740
What are your career aspirations?

226
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,340
What are your personal aspirations?

227
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:24,700
What kind of impact do you want to make on others?

228
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,180
Let's take that a little further.

229
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,820
What kind of impact do you want to make in the world?

230
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,260
I mean, have you ever really thought about where you want to be in the future?

231
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,740
Like really thought about it?

232
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,780
It's not always easy to picture, but it's really important to have a sense of what you

233
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,780
want in your life.

234
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:50,020
Because otherwise, again, it would be like driving around aimless.

235
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:55,380
These questions might seem big and overwhelming, and they are, but they're actually really

236
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:01,620
helpful in figuring out what you want to achieve in life, where you want to go.

237
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,740
And once you begin to have a sense of your long term vision, you can start breaking it

238
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:13,880
down into smaller, more manageable steps, more manageable goals, even breaking this

239
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,820
down and working backwards.

240
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:22,420
This is where you can really get specific about what you want to achieve and how you're

241
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,820
going to get there.

242
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,460
Let's say, for example, your long term vision is to become a doctor.

243
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,340
You love to help people.

244
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:36,300
Your goals might include, obviously, getting good grades in high school, then getting into

245
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:42,460
a good college, and then maybe volunteering at a local clinic or a nursing home while

246
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:48,940
studying to get into medical school, and eventually completing your residency.

247
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,460
Sounds so simple, right?

248
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,340
No, it does not.

249
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:59,620
But nowhere near overwhelming once you write down the steps and put them into blocks, right?

250
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,780
So you've gone from, oh, I'm just going to be a doctor.

251
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,780
Oh, OK.

252
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,780
Well, how?

253
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,780
I don't know.

254
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,140
And now you've said, I want to be a doctor.

255
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,580
Here are the steps I'm going to take.

256
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,420
And now I'm going to break them down.

257
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,700
And this is how I'm going to proceed.

258
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:19,500
Even just writing down the first draft is a great place to start.

259
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:25,100
But with all this being said, I also want you to remember, it's so important to remember

260
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,260
that your long term vision, your long term goals, they're not set in stone.

261
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,700
And it's OK to change your mind.

262
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:38,340
It's OK to adjust your goals as you go.

263
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,820
Life is full of surprises.

264
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,460
Sometimes our priorities and our aspirations, they shift along the way.

265
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,060
You see an exit sign here.

266
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,300
You see a coffee shop over there.

267
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:56,780
Don't be afraid to pivot and course correct when you need to.

268
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:05,220
And whether you're 17 or 73, it's never too late to ask yourself, where do I want to be?

269
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,620
So after this episode is done, I would love it if you just took the day or the evening

270
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,620
to yourself.

271
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,900
No distractions.

272
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,860
No external pressures.

273
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,860
Turn off your phone.

274
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,460
Sit with your thoughts and allow yourself to dream.

275
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,100
Like really dream big.

276
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Think about what truly matters to you, what you're passionate about and what you want

277
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,860
to achieve in life.

278
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,340
Don't forget this journey.

279
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,140
Enjoy it along the way.

280
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,540
Sometimes we get a little too serious about life.

281
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,700
Life is not just about achieving your goals.

282
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:54,300
It's also about experiencing new things, building meaningful relationships with new people and

283
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,900
finding joy right now, in this very moment.

284
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:05,620
So as you set your sights on the future, remember, appreciate the small things.

285
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,420
Savor every step of the way.

286
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,580
Find your long-term vision.

287
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:18,740
Write it out, as this will help keep you on the highway to success and fulfillment and

288
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,740
hopefully to life.

289
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:27,620
Your long-term vision can serve as a compass guiding you towards the life that you want

290
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:33,700
to lead and the person that you want to become.

291
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:39,580
So as we wrap up part one of this two or three part series, I encourage you to take some

292
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,940
time to think about where you want to be emotionally and in the long term.

293
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,220
It's a hard question.

294
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,860
Take the week to really chew through this.

295
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:57,820
It's not always easy to envision our future selves, but when we reflect on our values

296
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:04,900
and we begin setting emotional goals and defining our long-term vision, we start to create a

297
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,900
roadmap.

298
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:12,740
A roadmap, not only where we want to be physically, but also emotionally.

299
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,700
Remember, this is just the beginning of your journey.

300
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,060
It's okay if you're not sure where you want to go yet.

301
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,780
Take small steps.

302
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,540
Stay connected to your values.

303
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,980
Enjoy the ride along the way.

304
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:31,780
In part two of this series, we're going to explore some practical strategies for setting

305
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:38,180
and achieving these emotional and long-term goals.
